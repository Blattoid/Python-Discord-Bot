# Wheatley Discord Bot
This is a Discord bot I made in Python. It is based of the discord.py library and was created more or less for fun and to add moderation utilities that me or my friends find useful in our servers. It is named after and has the icon of the Wheatley Core from Portal 2. I did that because I thought it was funny, to be honest.


Please be aware that this is intended to be compiled with PyInstaller.


## History
Wheatley has existed for a long time, first popping into existence on the 11th of November, 2017. That was back when I first bought a software package on Steam called [Discord Bot Maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/682130/Discord_Bot_Maker/), which is based on NodeJS. At first, it was actually called Bender, but at some point I got the idea to call it Wheatley instead.

Over time the number of commands grew and grew, and Wheatley was on several servers. It was going so well... until I decided to try to upload the source code to GitHub.

#### 12th June 2018, 15:27-15:41: 'The Hack'
Let me tell a story when I accidentally leaked the API token back in 2018.

You see, when I uploaded the source code, I forgot to remove the hard coded bot token. I also did not know that people make web crawlers specifically to find these tokens that unsuspecting developers leak. I was on Discord on my phone at the time and I was startled when the channel I was scrolling on just disappeared. On the left hand side the list of channels rapidly shrank. The server was being deleted. The first thing I thought was: `"That can't be good"`. The next few minutes were total chaos as every channel in every server Wheatley was in was being nuked. My phone rung as my friend had also realised what was happening. On the phone he was panicked and confused, as was I. I had to explain to him that Wheatley had indeed been hacked. At some shortly point after that I tried to revoke the token to stop the firehose of delete commands. I was too late.

#### Wait, so is this unsafe??
In a word, no. The hack was entirely the result of my error and I take full responsibility. It was also over 7 months ago so this is in the past. Wheatley now reads the API token from an external file which is not in the repository. While there is a possibility of a security bug elsewhere, I have scrutized the code and I haven't found anything. **If you find a security bug please contact me about it directly.**
